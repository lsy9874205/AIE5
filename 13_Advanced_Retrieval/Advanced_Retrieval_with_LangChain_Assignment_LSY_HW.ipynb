That's essentially the plot of the movie. John Wick (Reeves) is out to seek revenge on the people who took something he loved from him. It's a beautifully simple premise for an action movie - when action movies get convoluted, they get bad i.e. A Good Day to Die Hard. John Wick gives the viewers what they want: Awesome action, stylish stunts, kinetic chaos, and a relatable hero to tie it all together. John Wick succeeds in its simplicity.\")"

        "\n",
        "3. **Multi-Query**  \n",
        "   - **Strengths**: Very high Faithfulness (0.95).  \n",
        "   - **Trade-Offs**: Lower Factual Correctness (0.284), potentially due to the complexity of multiple queries. May also be **more expensive** and **slower** due to generating and retrieving with multiple prompts.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Compression**  \n",
        "   - **Strengths**: Perfect Context Recall (1.0), indicating it surfaces all relevant content.  \n",
        "   - **Trade-Offs**: Faithfulness (0.685) and Factual Correctness (0.434) are respectable but not top-tier. Additional LLM passes can increase **cost** and **latency**.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Ensemble**  \n",
        "   - **Strengths**: Also achieves 1.0 Recall and strong Faithfulness (0.8583) by combining multiple methods.  \n",
        "   - **Trade-Offs**: Factual Correctness (0.296) remains low, and ensembling can be **costly** and **complex**.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. Conclusion\n",
        "For this dataset, **BM25** provides the highest Factual Correctness (0.484), making it appealing if correctness is the primary goal. **Multi-Query** excels at Faithfulness (0.95) but suffers in correctness. **Compression** and **Ensemble** both achieve perfect Recall but have middling correctness. Ultimately, the best choice depends on whether you prioritize **accuracy**, **speed**, or **cost**.\n"
