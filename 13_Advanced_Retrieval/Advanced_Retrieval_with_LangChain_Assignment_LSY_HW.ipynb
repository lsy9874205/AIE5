That's essentially the plot of the movie. John Wick (Reeves) is out to seek revenge on the people who took something he loved from him. It's a beautifully simple premise for an action movie - when action movies get convoluted, they get bad i.e. A Good Day to Die Hard. John Wick gives the viewers what they want: Awesome action, stylish stunts, kinetic chaos, and a relatable hero to tie it all together. John Wick succeeds in its simplicity.\")"

        "   - **Strengths**: Combines multiple retrieval strategies, moderate scores across the board.  \n",

        "### 4. Conclusion\n",
        "For this dataset, **Parent Document** stands out for best overall correctness (0.618), making it a strong choice if accuracy is the primary goal. **BM25** is still appealing for its **low cost**, **high recall**, and **fast** performance, even though correctness is lower. If the application needs the highest faithfulness and can afford multiple queries, **Multi-Query** may be an option. Ultimately, the “best” retriever depends on whether you prioritize **accuracy**, **speed**, or **cost**."
